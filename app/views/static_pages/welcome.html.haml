          In Annie Baker's enigmatic and entertaining The Antipodes ("endlessly fascinatingâ€¦" -- the NY Times) eight people brainstorm ideas for a story -- for a movie?  a TV pilot??  That's never revealed, but as one story leads to another more super-natural one, more is revealed and less is certain about these story-tellers. A great ensemble play about the how and the why of story-telling, and communication in general.
